# Reward Experience

Reward Experience is a simple, no configuration, lightweigth module to automatically reward players with experience point at the end of combats. 

Experience points are distributed equally to all partipating players like DnD5e rules suggests. While not tested, it should also work with any system as long as distribution method is good enough for you.
